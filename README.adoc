= MicroProfile Config used in Tests with SmallRye Config 


Some projects are using Microprofile Config within their codebase but when it comes to testing, they lack an implementation which can be used in tests as well.

This example project contains usage examples of https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config[SmallRye Config], an implementation of https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-config/[Eclipse MicroProfile Config].


== Running


[source,bash]
----
mvn install
